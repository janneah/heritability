# Heritability of disorders in the Danish health registers

Project for estimating heritability of all diagnoses with sufficient prevalence in the Danish health registers using twins and siblings.

The project is divided into three parts:
 - Definition of phenotypes through conversion of ICD8 and ICD10 to phecodes
 - Creation of twin and sibling cohorts
 - Heritability estimation using the method in [Repurposing large health insurance claims data to estimate genetic and environmental contributions in 560 phenotypes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0313-7)
